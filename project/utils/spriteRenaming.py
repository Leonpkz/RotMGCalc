"""
This file is to be used on the unnamed images extracted from the sprite sheets to make manually renaming the 
required images a little bit less torturous 

This will enable the following
	- to know exactly how many sprites should be in each <File> (seen in Equip.xml)
		- so none are missed, but those that are will be logged so I can manually review & amend
	- make things a bit easier than right click rename or some other CLI method
	- reduces human error to a degree
